# ALBA Proxy
The ALBA proxy sits between the Volume Driver and the ALBA backend. It runs as a process on the Storage Router host and takes the SCOs coming from the Volume Driver and stores them according to a policy on the backend.

More info on the ALBA proxy component can be found [here](https://openvstorage.gitbooks.io/alba).
